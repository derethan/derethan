## Welcome to my Gihub Portfolio, i'm Andrew Patterson
###  Aspiring Full Stack Developer with a Foundation in Manufacturing 

</div>


## A Brief Introduction
Dedicated and results-driven professional with a robust background in the automotive stamping industry. I bring several years of hands-on experience in manufacturing, coupled with a fervent passion for technology. My journey into the tech world began with an educational focus on computer networking administration, encompassing both hardware and software realms.

### Tech Enthusiast & Lifelong Learner:
Driven by a genuine enthusiasm for technology, I have been exploring the coding side of the industry since my teenage years. Now, I am transitioning my career path towards IT, with a keen interest in software development.

### Current Endeavours:
I am currently enrolled in Get Coding's Software Development program, where I am honing my skills to become a Full Stack Developer. My training includes hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I've recently celebrated the completion of my first public web application. In my next module, I am eager to delve deeper into React, Node.js, and MySQL, building on my existing knowledge to create more sophisticated applications.
